<p>The three most desirable qualities that our group thought were the most important were Crime & Safety, Schools, and Affordability in that order. What we care the most about is that we are safe in our homes without having to worry about potentially being forced to move out and spend more money on housing as a result of a dangerous crime near our area. We care about the availability and quality of education in our neighborhood the second most because we believe that a good education is essential for our future kids to obtain a successful future. Without quality education, it’s a lot harder to find a job. The third most important quality that we care about is affordability. Being in debt limits a lot of choices in life. We want to be financially stable and not have to spend our lifetime paying back loans. While other qualities like nightlife, diversity, and transportation are also extremely important, we believe that for the sake of a more stable future, it is these three qualities that we should prioritize.</p>

<p>The three neighborhoods in Manhattan that we chose were StuyTown, Hell’s Kitchen, and Washington Heights. It’s interesting to see how StuyTown (zip codes 10009 and 10010) is dominated by Middle Income Units. For StuyTown, Middle Income Units make up 69.0% of all units, meanwhile, the total of all Extremely Low Income Units, Very Low Income Units, and Income Units only make up 27.8% of all units. When compared to Hell’s Kitchen (zip codes 10018, 10019, and 10036) and Washington Heights (zip code 10033), based on the data, it seems like StuyTown is a much less affordable neighborhood than StuyTown. While it’s a little harder to compare Hell’s Kitchen and Washington Heights, while Washington Heights does have a much higher percentage of Low Income Units (39.5%) compared to Hell’s Kitchen (32.5%), when looking at the total of all Extremely Low Income Units, Very Low Income Units, and Low Income Units, Hell’s Kitchen has a slightly higher percentage of 78.6% compared to Washington Heights’ 76.5%. For this reason, we conclude that Hell’s Kitchen is the most affordable neighborhood out of these three neighborhoods.</p>
