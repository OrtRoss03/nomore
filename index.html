<p>The three most desirable qualities that our group thought were the most important were Crime & Safety, Schools, and Affordability in that order. What we care the most about is that we are safe in our homes without having to worry about potentially being forced to move out and spend more money on housing as a result of a dangerous crime near our area. We care about the availability and quality of education in our neighborhood the second most because we believe that a good education is essential for our future kids to obtain a successful future. Without quality education, it’s a lot harder to find a job. The third most important quality that we care about is affordability. Being in debt limits a lot of choices in life. We want to be financially stable and not have to spend our lifetime paying back loans. While other qualities like nightlife, diversity, and transportation are also extremely important, we believe that for the sake of a more stable future, it is these three qualities that we should prioritize.</p>
